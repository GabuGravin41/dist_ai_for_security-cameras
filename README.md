# Distributed AI CCTV System

This project simulates a distributed AI-powered CCTV system for ARM-based infrastructure. It demonstrates facial recognition across multiple simulated cameras on a laptop, coordinated by a Flask server on an AWS Graviton instance (ARM-based).

## Features

- Distributed AI processing: Video processing at the edge, coordination in the cloud
- Multiple camera support: Run simulations with multiple video feeds
- Webcam integration: Use your laptop's webcam as an additional camera
- Real-time alerts: Face detections are sent to a central server
- Web interface: View recent detections via a simple web dashboard
